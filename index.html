          <p>RC planes are small model <code>radio-controlled airplanes</code> that fly using electric motor, gas poweredIC engines or small model jet engines. The RC Airplanes are flown remotely with the help of atransmitter with joysticks that can be used to fly the aircraft and perform different maneuvers.</p>
          <p>The transmitter comes also with a receiver which is installed inside the Model RC Airplaneswhich receives the commands send by the transmitter and controls servos. The servos are smallmotors which are mechanically linked to the control surfaces e.g., ailerons for roll control,elevator for pitch control and rudder for yaw control. The servos moves the control rods (whichare small rods that connect the servo to different flight control e.g. to elevator etc) which in turnmoves the control surface be it elevator, flaps, aileron or rudder. An RC Airplane can be controlled in flight by using the transmitter from where you can control pitch, yaw and roll ofyour RC Airplane and you can also control the throttle settings. The receiver which accepts thetransmitter signal and the servos attached to it are run on rechargeable batteries. Most popularrechargeable batteries for RC Airplanes use include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ni-Cad (Nickel Cadmium),</li>
            <li>Li-Po(Lithium Polymer).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Lithium Polymer lasts longer and more powerful than there Ni-Cadcounterparts but a bit more expensive.</p>

          <header>RC Electric Motors</header>
          <p>Electric motors are most used in many model RC Airplanes because of the ease in us. ElectricMotors give the advantage of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Low-cost,</li>
            <li>Eeasy to use.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <code>throttle</code> of electric motors is controlledusing a speed controller which comes with the motor.</p>
          <p>The speed controller lead is connected tothe receiver. The transmitter than can control the throttle of electric motor just as other controls.</p>

        <section id="Fuselage" class="main-section">
          <header>Fuselage</header>
          <p>Fuselage is the main structural element of the RC Airplane or the body of the RC Airplane. The Wing, Horizontal and Vertical Tail are connected to the fuselage. The Engine is also mounted tothe fuselage. The fuselage is made up of bulk-heads. The bulk-heads are structural memberswhich give strength and rigidity to the fuselage, support load and weight of the RC Airplane</p>
          <p>The Engine bulk-head is made relatively stronger as compared to other bulk-heads of RC Airplanefuselage because it carriers the load of the engine as well as encounters vibrations during engineoperation so it must be strong to resist all the loads. The nose gear and main landing gear are alsoconnected to the fuselage. The fuselage also houses all the electronic components necessary for RC Airplane flight including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>ESC (electronic speed controller)</code>, in case of electric RC Airplane,</li>
            <li>Receiver,</li>
            <li>Servos,</li>
            <li>Batteries and fuel tank in case of gas powered RC Airplane.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>External orinternal payloads are also carried inside the fuselage. The fuselage can be used to connect anexternal camera for example or to carry some payload inside the RC Airplane.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Wings" class="main-section">
          <header>Wings</header>
          <p>Wings are the main lifting body of the RC Airplane providing the lift necessary for RC Airplane flight. The wing provides lift because of its aerodynamic shape which creates a pressuredifferential causing lift. If a cross-section of the wing is cut, a shape or profile is visible which is called an airfoil.</p>
          <p><code>Airfoil</code> shape is the key to the wings ability to provide lift and is airfoil selectionand design is an important criterion in the design of RC Airplanes.</p>
          <p>The front most edge of thewing is known as leading edge and the aft most edge of the wing is known as the trailing edge.There are typically three kinds of airfoils which are used on RC Airplanes namely, symmetrical airfoils, semi-symmetrical airfoils and heavily cambered airfoils. On the wing are mounted theflaps and ailerons.</p>

        <section id="Propeller" class="main-section">
          <header>Propeller</header>
          <p>The propeller is basically a <code>wing section</code> made of airfoil sections just like a wing but it is twistedalong the span.</p>
          <p>The propeller is mounted to the engine in propeller driven RC airplanes. Jet
  engine RC Airplanes donâ€™t have a propeller and generates thrust by means of the jet engine.

        <section id="Elevators" class="main-section">
          <header>Elevators</header>
          <p>Elevators are the <code>pitch-control</code> control surfaces of the RC Airplanes. Elevators provide pitchcontrol by moving either up or down simultaneously causing the airplane to pitch about thecenter of gravity of RC Airplane.</p>
          <p>When elevator is moved up the nose of the airplane rises and isknown as pitch up. When the elevator is moved down the nose of the RC Airplane moves downand is known as pitch down.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Rudder" class="main-section">
          <header>Rudder</header>
          <p>Rudder is the <code>yaw-control</code> control surface of the RC Airplanes. Rudder provides yaw control bymoving to either side be it left or right. The rudder yaws the RC Airplane about the center ofgravity cg of RC Airplane causing the RC Airplane nose to move right or to move left</p>
          <p>A rightrudder maneuver causes the RC Airplane to move to the right. A left rudder maneuver causes theRC Airplane to the left.</p>
